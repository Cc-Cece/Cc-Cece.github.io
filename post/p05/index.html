                <p>In recent years, we have witnessed China's continuous GDP growth. Yet, an undeniable reality has also emerged: it's getting harder and harder to make a living. Small businesses are collapsing, large corporations are laying off staff and cutting salaries, and young people are struggling in the job market. This stark contrast between macroeconomic data and personal experience reveals deep-seated structural issues in the Chinese economy. This isn't just an economic fluctuation; it's a major eruption of the inherent contradictions within the &quot;China model.&quot;</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-illusion-of-gdp-growth-inefficient-production-and-wealth-evaporation">The Illusion of GDP Growth: Inefficient Production and Wealth Evaporation</h3>
<p>Why are GDP figures looking good while our lives aren't improving? This stems from a long-ignored truth: <strong>GDP measures total output, not wealth creation.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a factory that produces a million units of a product. Due to quality issues or market saturation, these products are eventually sold off at a price below cost or even disposed of as waste. In this process, the &quot;output&quot; of a million units will be tallied in the GDP, but the factory itself is losing money. Workers' wages can't increase, and they may even face layoffs. This is the essence of China's current &quot;involution&quot;—<strong>inefficient production</strong>.</p>
<p>As companies are forced into endless price wars to survive, the profit on each product is squeezed to the extreme. This leads to society's resources being poured into unprofitable production. Everyone is busy, but they are creating negative value. In this competitive model, the GDP figure becomes a giant mirage. It looks glamorous, but behind it lies the exhaustion of corporate profits and the loss of public wealth.</p>
<p>When this inefficient production reaches a tipping point, it triggers <strong>deflation</strong>. Prices fall continuously, which seems good for consumers but is a slow-acting poison. It kills corporate profits, forcing them to lay off staff and cut salaries, which in turn weakens overall consumption. When consumers stop spending, companies further lower prices, creating a self-reinforcing vicious cycle. Just look at China's CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index) data, and we must admit that this country, once seen as the &quot;world's factory,&quot; is mired in deflation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-self-inflicted-anti-involution-campaign">A Self-Inflicted &quot;Anti-Involution&quot; Campaign</h3>
<p>Faced with the threat of deflation, the CCP has finally stepped in to &quot;fight involution,&quot; attempting to forcefully reverse the situation through administrative means. From the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission meeting on July 1st, to the major article in the &quot;Qiushi&quot; journal on the 24th, to the summoning of industry giants like BYD and Meituan, and even the first amendment to the &quot;Pricing Law&quot; in 27 years to explicitly prohibit below-cost dumping—this all seems like swift and decisive governance. But we must ask: <strong>who caused this situation in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is: <strong>they did.</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;concentrating power to accomplish big things&quot; model was once the engine of China's economic miracle, but now, it is a shackle stifling economic vitality. When state will, rather than market demand, dictates the flow of resources, overcapacity becomes an inevitable tragedy. Past massive subsidies for solar and new energy vehicles were like feeding a baby an overdose of hormones, causing it to swell up in a distorted manner. These industries appear to be &quot;far ahead,&quot; but their profits are razor-thin, and some entire sectors are even operating at a loss.</p>
<p>For example, the solar industry's overall profit in the first half of 2024 declined by over 100%, with cumulative losses of tens of billions of yuan. Everyone knows this is a result of overcapacity, but no company is willing to voluntarily cut production. They all know that whoever cuts production first will be the first to be eliminated from the market. This &quot;prisoner's dilemma&quot; is fueled by local governments' &quot;GDP-only&quot; performance evaluation system. In the eyes of local officials, companies produce not goods, but political achievements. They will do whatever it takes to protect these companies that should have been phased out, even using subsidies and low-interest loans to completely disable the market's &quot;invisible hand.&quot; This has thoroughly blocked the natural law of survival of the fittest in the Chinese economy, and the phenomenon of bad money driving out good money is getting worse.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-vicious-cycle-of-history-and-inability-to-break-free">A Vicious Cycle of History and Inability to Break Free</h3>
<p>This &quot;anti-involution&quot; campaign is not unprecedented. The &quot;textile spindle reduction&quot; in 1998 and the &quot;supply-side structural reform&quot; in 2016 were similar campaigns to cut capacity. History shows us that the CCP can use powerful administrative means to forcibly solve supply-side problems in the short term. But the issue is that these are all stop-gap measures that don't address the root cause.</p>
<p>Past capacity-cutting campaigns were all accompanied by a massive &quot;backstop&quot; mechanism: <strong>real estate</strong>. This immense wealth reservoir served as a stabilizer during every economic crisis, absorbing surplus labor and resources. For instance, after the 2008 global financial crisis, the government's four-trillion-yuan stimulus plan, primarily through real estate and infrastructure, successfully drove economic growth and provided an outlet for excess steel and cement industries. But today, this reservoir itself is on the verge of collapse. A patient who is used to using strong medicine to survive, when the only life-saving medicine fails, where can they go?</p>
<p>More importantly, cutting capacity only solves the problem of oversupply, not insufficient demand. In a time of a weak economy and a deteriorating international environment, forcibly shutting down factories will only increase unemployment and further weaken consumption. If the ultimate result is rising prices with no increase in people's income, then what kind of victory can that be called?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="whose-victory-whose-tragedy">Whose Victory, Whose Tragedy?</h3>
<p>The essence of involution is a problem of <strong>resource allocation</strong>. When resources and capital are excessively concentrated in the hands of a few &quot;winner-take-all&quot; giants, there is no room for small and medium-sized enterprises to survive, and the income of ordinary people cannot be raised. Do you think your job and income are more related to a few &quot;far ahead&quot; leading enterprises or to the thriving development of tens of thousands of small and micro-enterprises in the supply chain?</p>
<p>The grueling lives of ordinary Chinese people are precisely the result of these &quot;national enterprises&quot; engaging in extreme involution and endless exploitation. No matter how big Huawei, Xiaomi, and BYD become, will your life get better because of it? Does the so-called &quot;rise of a great power&quot; have anything to do with you? A healthy economy should be one where wealth can penetrate every capillary of society, not just pile up in the glossy financial reports of a few leading companies.</p>
<p>The true way out lies in addressing the root cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the <strong>market to return to its dominant role</strong> and stop excessive intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Reform the official evaluation system</strong> and abandon &quot;GDP-only&quot; metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Reallocate resources</strong> to allow the private economy to develop in a fair environment and truly enrich the people.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all three of these points touch the very foundation of the CCP's system. They know where the problem lies but are unable to make real changes. This is the deepest tragedy of the Chinese economy and its entire system. When a ruler knows the correct answer but cannot implement it due to their own interests, they are destined to struggle in contradictions.</p>
