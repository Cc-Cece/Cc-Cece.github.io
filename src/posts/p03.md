When we look up and see a plane carrying dozens of tons of weight soar through the sky, have you ever wondered: how does it fly? The question seems simple, and the answer seems obvious: lift generated by the wings.

But if you were to ask a top aerodynamicist, they might give you a knowing smile and say, "It's complicated."

This isn't a clever evasion. In the world of science, some questions are far more complex than they appear. The phenomenon of flight is a perfect example. It reveals a profound truth: **the true beauty of science lies not just in perfect theories, but in the unending exploration where theory and practice intertwine.**

## **The Theory's Dilemma: There Is No Single Perfect Answer**


The physics we learn in school often attributes lift to two principles: **Bernoulli's Principle** and **Newton's Third Law**.

- **The "Equal Transit Time" Fallacy**: This explanation, based on Bernoulli's principle, suggests that air traveling over the curved top of the wing must speed up to meet the air on the flatter bottom surface at the same time. This faster air creates lower pressure, generating lift. However, modern experiments have long proven this "equal transit time" assumption to be false.
- **The "Skipping Stone" Theory**: This explanation, based on Newton's Third Law, likens a plane to a skipping stone. It says the wing pushes air downwards, creating an equal and opposite upward force. The problem with this theory is that it only accounts for the contribution of the wing's lower surface, completely ignoring the **low-pressure area on the top surface, which generates the majority of the total lift**.

Neither of these theories is entirely wrong—they both describe parts of how lift is created. But neither provides a complete, rigorous, and flawless explanation. This "imperfection" in our theoretical understanding is precisely why some people claim that the principles of flight are still not fully figured out.

## **The Triumph of Practice: How to Do It Precedes Why It Works**


Despite the theoretical challenges, humanity's conquest of the skies was not halted. On the contrary, the story of flight is a triumph of **engineering practice** over theoretical limitations.

The Wright brothers didn't achieve flight with a perfect physical theory. They did it through extensive **wind tunnel experiments**, tirelessly testing different wing shapes to find a design that produced enough lift. They were brilliant engineers who proved that flight was possible through hands-on practice.

Today, we have far more advanced tools. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and powerful wind tunnels allow us to precisely predict and control a plane's performance. When a plane is designed, it goes through countless simulations and tests to ensure its safety and reliability. We can confidently say that **planes are "blown" out of a wind tunnel.**

This ability to solve problems even when a perfect theory is lacking is the essence of engineering. It teaches us that sometimes, **the knowledge of "how to do it" comes before the understanding of "why it works."**

## **The Beauty of Science: An Endless Journey**


The story of flight gives us a broader perspective on what science truly is.

In medicine, we know the effective doses and safe ranges for anesthetics, but we still don't fully understand their exact mechanisms on the nervous system. In AI, neural networks can produce incredible results, but their decision-making process often remains a "black box" that we cannot fully explain.

This isn't a failure—it's the nature of science. **Engineering practice provides us with the tools to solve real-world problems, while theoretical exploration constantly seeks the ultimate truth.** They complement each other, pushing human progress forward.

So, the next time someone asks you, "How does a plane fly?" you can tell them that we have a complete and total grasp of how to make it fly safely, and we understand the major principles behind it. As for that single, perfect theory that explains everything? It may not exist yet—**and that's the most fascinating part of all.**
