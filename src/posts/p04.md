During your lunch break, you casually open a short video app and mindlessly scroll. A funny sketch, a cute pet video, a beautiful drone shot... each video is like a small candy, instantly satisfying your curiosity and providing a quick burst of pleasure.

You tell yourself, "Just one more, then I'll get back to work." However, before you know it, twenty minutes, half an hour, or even a full hour has slipped away. What you've scrolled away isn't just time, but your precious and scarce attention.

You might think you're just enjoying some leisure, but you don't realize your time is being quietly **commodified** in this process. At its core, this is a carefully designed transaction where your **attention** is the currency. This isn't just entertainment; it's a silent commercial game.

## Attention: The Extracted "Digital Gold"


In the digital age, attention has become the new **"digital gold."** The business model of platforms like TikTok isn't the videos themselves, but every second you spend on them.

The platform uses sophisticated algorithms to record what you like, what you dislike, where you pause, and what you quickly swipe past. Every like, comment, and share you make provides valuable fuel for this algorithm.

This data is compiled into detailed "user profiles" and then sold to advertisers. Advertisers can then precisely know when, in what scenario, and to whom to push certain products.

Your time, emotions, and preferences are all quantified, analyzed, and ultimately turned into tradable commercial value. You think you're passively consuming content, but you're actually becoming a commodity that can be priced.

## Algorithms: The Trap That Captures Time


The **"addictive" mechanism** of short videos is key to this commodification of time. The algorithm's goal isn't to provide you with the best content, but to maximize your time on the platform. It continuously pushes content that can stir your emotions and pique your curiosity.

When you watch a makeup tutorial, it will show you more videos from beauty influencers; when you comment on a social hot topic, it will push more related content to you.

This mechanism immerses you in an **information cocoon**, where your world is shaped by the algorithm. Your way of thinking, aesthetic tastes, and even consumption desires are quietly altered by this invisible influence.

Here, time is no longer a purely personal experience but a variable that can be designed, manipulated, and extended to create more commercial value. Your time and attention are cleverly captured by the platform and converted into real profit.

## A Warning: Your "Leisure" Is Also a Resource


We must clearly recognize that in the digital world, almost all seemingly free "services" have a clear commercial purpose behind them. Short video apps are a classic example, but the same thing happens on social media, news sites, and even some free games.

Cunning people will package our most valuable resources—time and attention—into various tempting commodities and then subtly **"exploit"** them.

In this era, we need more than just to enjoy convenience; we also need the clarity to discern right from wrong. The next time you pick up your phone, ready to fall into an endless scroll, take a second to think: is every second you're spending really just for amusement? Or, without realizing it, are you giving away your most valuable time as a commodity?
