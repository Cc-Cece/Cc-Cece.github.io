Yet, an undeniable reality has also emerged: it's getting harder and harder to make a living. Small businesses are collapsing, large corporations are laying off staff and cutting salaries, and young people are struggling in the job market. This stark contrast between macroeconomic data and personal experience reveals deep-seated structural issues in the Chinese economy. This isn't just an economic fluctuation; it's a major eruption of the inherent contradictions within the &quot;China model.&quot;</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="the-illusion-of-gdp-growth-inefficient-production-and-wealth-evaporation">The Illusion of GDP Growth: Inefficient Production and Wealth Evaporation</h3>
<p>Why are GDP figures looking good while our lives aren't improving? This stems from a long-ignored truth: <strong>GDP measures total output, not wealth creation.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a factory that produces a million units of a product. Due to quality issues or market saturation, these products are eventually sold off at a price below cost or even disposed of as waste. In this process, the &quot;output&quot; of a million units will be tallied in the GDP, but the factory itself is losing money. Workers' wages can't increase, and they may even face layoffs. This is the essence of China's current &quot;involution&quot;—<strong>inefficient production</strong>.</p>
<p>As companies are forced into endless price wars to survive, the profit on each product is squeezed to the extreme. This leads to society's resources being poured into unprofitable production. Everyone is busy, but they are creating negative value. In this competitive model, the GDP figure becomes a giant mirage. It looks glamorous, but behind it lies the exhaustion of corporate profits and the loss of public wealth.</p>
<p>When this inefficient production reaches a tipping point, it triggers <strong>deflation</strong>. Prices fall continuously, which seems good for consumers but is a slow-acting poison. It kills corporate profits, forcing them to lay off staff and cut salaries, which in turn weakens overall consumption. When consumers stop spending, companies further lower prices, creating a self-reinforcing vicious cycle. Just look at China's CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PPI (Producer Price Index) data, and we must admit that this country, once seen as the &quot;world's factory,&quot; is mired in deflation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-self-inflicted-anti-involution-campaign">A Self-Inflicted &quot;Anti-Involution&quot; Campaign</h3>
<p>Faced with the threat of deflation, the CCP has finally stepped in to &quot;fight involution,&quot; attempting to forcefully reverse the situation through administrative means. From the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission meeting on July 1st, to the major article in the &quot;Qiushi&quot; journal on the 24th, to the summoning of industry giants like BYD and Meituan, and even the first amendment to the &quot;Pricing Law&quot; in 27 years to explicitly prohibit below-cost dumping—this all seems like swift and decisive governance. But we must ask: <strong>who caused this situation in the first place?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is: <strong>they did.</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;concentrating power to accomplish big things&quot; model was once the engine of China's economic miracle, but now, it is a shackle stifling economic vitality. When state will, rather than market demand, dictates the flow of resources, overcapacity becomes an inevitable tragedy. Past massive subsidies for solar and new energy vehicles were like feeding a baby an overdose of hormones, causing it to swell up in a distorted manner. These industries appear to be &quot;far ahead,&quot; but their profits are razor-thin, and some entire sectors are even operating at a loss.</p>
<p>For example, the solar industry's overall profit in the first half of 2024 declined by over 100%, with cumulative losses of tens of billions of yuan. Everyone knows this is a result of overcapacity, but no company is willing to voluntarily cut production. They all know that whoever cuts production first will be the first to be eliminated from the market. This &quot;prisoner's dilemma&quot; is fueled by local governments' &quot;GDP-only&quot; performance evaluation system. In the eyes of local officials, companies produce not goods, but political achievements. They will do whatever it takes to protect these companies that should have been phased out, even using subsidies and low-interest loans to completely disable the market's &quot;invisible hand.&quot; This has thoroughly blocked the natural law of survival of the fittest in the Chinese economy, and the phenomenon of bad money driving out good money is getting worse.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-vicious-cycle-of-history-and-inability-to-break-free">A Vicious Cycle of History and Inability to Break Free</h3>
<p>This &quot;anti-involution&quot; campaign is not unprecedented. The &quot;textile spindle reduction&quot; in 1998 and the &quot;supply-side structural reform&quot; in 2016 were similar campaigns to cut capacity. History shows us that the CCP can use powerful administrative means to forcibly solve supply-side problems in the short term. But the issue is that these are all stop-gap measures that don't address the root cause.</p>
<p>Past capacity-cutting campaigns were all accompanied by a massive &quot;backstop&quot; mechanism: <strong>real estate</strong>. This immense wealth reservoir served as a stabilizer during every economic crisis, absorbing surplus labor and resources. For instance, after the 2008 global financial crisis, the government's four-trillion-yuan stimulus plan, primarily through real estate and infrastructure, successfully drove economic growth and provided an outlet for excess steel and cement industries. But today, this reservoir itself is on the verge of collapse. A patient who is used to using strong medicine to survive, when the only life-saving medicine fails, where can they go?</p>
<p>More importantly, cutting capacity only solves the problem of oversupply, not insufficient demand. In a time of a weak economy and a deteriorating international environment, forcibly shutting down factories will only increase unemployment and further weaken consumption. If the ultimate result is rising prices with no increase in people's income, then what kind of victory can that be called?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="whose-victory-whose-tragedy">Whose Victory, Whose Tragedy?</h3>
<p>The essence of involution is a problem of <strong>resource allocation</strong>. When resources and capital are excessively concentrated in the hands of a few &quot;winner-take-all&quot; giants, there is no room for small and medium-sized enterprises to survive, and the income of ordinary people cannot be raised. Do you think your job and income are more related to a few &quot;far ahead&quot; leading enterprises or to the thriving development of tens of thousands of small and micro-enterprises in the supply chain?</p>
<p>The grueling lives of ordinary Chinese people are precisely the result of these &quot;national enterprises&quot; engaging in extreme involution and endless exploitation. No matter how big Huawei, Xiaomi, and BYD become, will your life get better because of it? Does the so-called &quot;rise of a great power&quot; have anything to do with you? A healthy economy should be one where wealth can penetrate every capillary of society, not just pile up in the glossy financial reports of a few leading companies.</p>
<p>The true way out lies in addressing the root cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the <strong>market to return to its dominant role</strong> and stop excessive intervention.</li>
<li><strong>Reform the official evaluation system</strong> and abandon &quot;GDP-only&quot; metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Reallocate resources</strong> to allow the private economy to develop in a fair environment and truly enrich the people.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, all three of these points touch the very foundation of the CCP's system. They know where the problem lies but are unable to make real changes. This is the deepest tragedy of the Chinese economy and its entire system. When a ruler knows the correct answer but cannot implement it due to their own interests, they are destined to struggle in contradictions.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During your lunch break, you casually open a short video app and mindlessly scroll. A funny sketch, a cute pet video, a beautiful drone shot... each video is like a small candy, instantly satisfying your curiosity and providing a quick burst of pleasure.</p>
<p>You tell yourself, &quot;Just one more, then I'll get back to work.&quot; However, before you know it, twenty minutes, half an hour, or even a full hour has slipped away. What you've scrolled away isn't just time, but your precious and scarce attention.</p>
<p>You might think you're just enjoying some leisure, but you don't realize your time is being quietly <strong>commodified</strong> in this process. At its core, this is a carefully designed transaction where your <strong>attention</strong> is the currency. This isn't just entertainment; it's a silent commercial game.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="attention-the-extracted-digital-gold">Attention: The Extracted &quot;Digital Gold&quot;</h2>
<p>In the digital age, attention has become the new <strong>&quot;digital gold.&quot;</strong> The business model of platforms like TikTok isn't the videos themselves, but every second you spend on them.</p>
<p>The platform uses sophisticated algorithms to record what you like, what you dislike, where you pause, and what you quickly swipe past. Every like, comment, and share you make provides valuable fuel for this algorithm.</p>
<p>This data is compiled into detailed &quot;user profiles&quot; and then sold to advertisers. Advertisers can then precisely know when, in what scenario, and to whom to push certain products.</p>
<p>Your time, emotions, and preferences are all quantified, analyzed, and ultimately turned into tradable commercial value. You think you're passively consuming content, but you're actually becoming a commodity that can be priced.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="algorithms-the-trap-that-captures-time">Algorithms: The Trap That Captures Time</h2>
<p>The <strong>&quot;addictive&quot; mechanism</strong> of short videos is key to this commodification of time. The algorithm's goal isn't to provide you with the best content, but to maximize your time on the platform. It continuously pushes content that can stir your emotions and pique your curiosity.</p>
<p>When you watch a makeup tutorial, it will show you more videos from beauty influencers; when you comment on a social hot topic, it will push more related content to you.</p>
<p>This mechanism immerses you in an <strong>information cocoon</strong>, where your world is shaped by the algorithm. Your way of thinking, aesthetic tastes, and even consumption desires are quietly altered by this invisible influence.</p>
<p>Here, time is no longer a purely personal experience but a variable that can be designed, manipulated, and extended to create more commercial value. Your time and attention are cleverly captured by the platform and converted into real profit.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-warning-your-leisure-is-also-a-resource">A Warning: Your &quot;Leisure&quot; Is Also a Resource</h2>
<p>We must clearly recognize that in the digital world, almost all seemingly free &quot;services&quot; have a clear commercial purpose behind them. Short video apps are a classic example, but the same thing happens on social media, news sites, and even some free games.</p>
<p>Cunning people will package our most valuable resources—time and attention—into various tempting commodities and then subtly <strong>&quot;exploit&quot;</strong> them.</p>
<p>In this era, we need more than just to enjoy convenience; we also need the clarity to discern right from wrong. The next time you pick up your phone, ready to fall into an endless scroll, take a second to think: is every second you're spending really just for amusement? Or, without realizing it, are you giving away your most valuable time as a commodity?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we look up and see a plane carrying dozens of tons of weight soar through the sky, have you ever wondered: how does it fly? The question seems simple, and the answer seems obvious: lift generated by the wings.</p>
<p>But if you were to ask a top aerodynamicist, they might give you a knowing smile and say, &quot;It's complicated.&quot;</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>This isn't a clever evasion. In the world of science, some questions are far more complex than they appear. The phenomenon of flight is a perfect example. It reveals a profound truth: <strong>the true beauty of science lies not just in perfect theories, but in the unending exploration where theory and practice intertwine.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-theorys-dilemma-there-is-no-single-perfect-answer"><strong>The Theory's Dilemma: There Is No Single Perfect Answer</strong></h2>
<p>The physics we learn in school often attributes lift to two principles: <strong>Bernoulli's Principle</strong> and <strong>Newton's Third Law</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The &quot;Equal Transit Time&quot; Fallacy</strong>: This explanation, based on Bernoulli's principle, suggests that air traveling over the curved top of the wing must speed up to meet the air on the flatter bottom surface at the same time. This faster air creates lower pressure, generating lift. However, modern experiments have long proven this &quot;equal transit time&quot; assumption to be false.</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;Skipping Stone&quot; Theory</strong>: This explanation, based on Newton's Third Law, likens a plane to a skipping stone. It says the wing pushes air downwards, creating an equal and opposite upward force. The problem with this theory is that it only accounts for the contribution of the wing's lower surface, completely ignoring the <strong>low-pressure area on the top surface, which generates the majority of the total lift</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither of these theories is entirely wrong—they both describe parts of how lift is created. But neither provides a complete, rigorous, and flawless explanation. This &quot;imperfection&quot; in our theoretical understanding is precisely why some people claim that the principles of flight are still not fully figured out.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-triumph-of-practice-how-to-do-it-precedes-why-it-works"><strong>The Triumph of Practice: How to Do It Precedes Why It Works</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the theoretical challenges, humanity's conquest of the skies was not halted. On the contrary, the story of flight is a triumph of <strong>engineering practice</strong> over theoretical limitations.</p>
<p>The Wright brothers didn't achieve flight with a perfect physical theory. They did it through extensive <strong>wind tunnel experiments</strong>, tirelessly testing different wing shapes to find a design that produced enough lift. They were brilliant engineers who proved that flight was possible through hands-on practice.</p>
<p>Today, we have far more advanced tools. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and powerful wind tunnels allow us to precisely predict and control a plane's performance. When a plane is designed, it goes through countless simulations and tests to ensure its safety and reliability. We can confidently say that <strong>planes are &quot;blown&quot; out of a wind tunnel.</strong></p>
<p>This ability to solve problems even when a perfect theory is lacking is the essence of engineering. It teaches us that sometimes, <strong>the knowledge of &quot;how to do it&quot; comes before the understanding of &quot;why it works.&quot;</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-beauty-of-science-an-endless-journey"><strong>The Beauty of Science: An Endless Journey</strong></h2>
<p>The story of flight gives us a broader perspective on what science truly is.</p>
<p>In medicine, we know the effective doses and safe ranges for anesthetics, but we still don't fully understand their exact mechanisms on the nervous system. In AI, neural networks can produce incredible results, but their decision-making process often remains a &quot;black box&quot; that we cannot fully explain.</p>
<p>This isn't a failure—it's the nature of science. <strong>Engineering practice provides us with the tools to solve real-world problems, while theoretical exploration constantly seeks the ultimate truth.</strong> They complement each other, pushing human progress forward.</p>
<p>So, the next time someone asks you, &quot;How does a plane fly?&quot; you can tell them that we have a complete and total grasp of how to make it fly safely, and we understand the major principles behind it. As for that single, perfect theory that explains everything? It may not exist yet—<strong>and that's the most fascinating part of all.</strong></p>

]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I’m going to reveal a secret: how I found your Steam account!</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>That’s right! I know all your secrets. Well, that’s not quite accurate, but let’s pretend for a moment.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this information age, our data is being collected all the time. Countless computers in the background are analyzing who we are, what we want, how we feel, and so on. Ad networks often use this data to target ads precisely, hoping we'll click on them more often.</p>
<p>You might think not every piece of information is valuable, but the opposite is true. Data is often used to deanonymize anonymous users on the internet. No one is completely safe! That includes you and your Steam account!</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Steam, it’s essentially a digital game store and social platform. You can buy games on it, add friends, and view their game libraries and wishlists.</p>
<p>Unlike many social media platforms, a Steam Wishlist is usually public, even if your profile is private. This means anyone can see which games you hope to buy.</p>
<p>This is where the fun begins.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-i-found-your-steam-account">How I Found Your Steam Account</h2>
<p>To find your Steam account, I needed to do some detective work. I had to figure out what you were interested in. How, you might ask? By simply asking you! After all, this is a little game.</p>
<p>I asked you for a few games you were particularly keen on playing, and you—a lovely gamer—gave me a list of 10 games. You were very cooperative and didn’t try to mislead me with some irrelevant games (I appreciate that).</p>
<p>Then, I used these games to search on Steam. Each game has a community hub, and I looked at all the users who had added all of these games to their wishlists. There were a total of 12,000 users. If you think about it, this number isn’t huge, but it was a great start because you were hiding among them!</p>
<p>Next, I found all the public game libraries among those 12,000 users. I then discovered that 152 of those users all owned <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, a game you had mentioned was your favorite in a chat.</p>
<h2 id="a-breakthrough">A Breakthrough</h2>
<p>I still couldn’t pinpoint which one was you.</p>
<p>Then I had a sudden flash of inspiration! You once told me that you are an achievement hunter, always liking to challenge those super difficult achievements, like those in the <em>Dark Souls</em> series.</p>
<p>This might not sound like a big deal, but it’s actually very crucial. When you want to remain anonymous on the internet, you have to be careful not to stand out too much. And as an achievement hunter, you were doing exactly that!</p>
<p>I checked the Steam profiles of those 152 users and found that 4 of them had all earned a particularly difficult achievement in <em>Dark Souls 3</em>: &quot;The Nameless King.&quot; The other 149 users had not.</p>
<p>The scope was narrowed even further! I was almost certain your account was one of those four.</p>
<p>Since this was a game, I decided to ask you directly: Does your Steam username contain the word &quot;Dragon&quot;? You answered &quot;yes.&quot; Among those four usernames, only one contained that word.</p>
<p>That's how I found your Steam account!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you want to stay anonymous on the internet, please be careful. While this was just a little game between me and a friend, linking data from different sources can indeed reveal who we are.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this little story, and remember: don't make yourself too unique!</p>
